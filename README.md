surfshark是一个不错的VPN,但是在中国因为DNS污染无法正确解析和连接。
因此写一个脚本来处理DNS问题。
python3写的,可以将域名*.surfshark.com解析到正确的ip从而解决连接问题。


surfshark is a good VPN, but cannot resolve and connect properly in China due to DNS pollution.
So write a script to deal with DNS issues.
Written in python3, it can resolve the domain name *.surfshark.com to the correct ip to solve the connection question.
